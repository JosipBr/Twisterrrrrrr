<section class="article">
    <p>The Twister community has been working hard lately to gather people all around the world for this amazing event. As we already know, on the 1st of August 2021 Twister and Twicth have made a deal to create a <b>"Twister Twitch Rivals event"</b> that will be held on the <b>5th of January</b>. The event will be streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twisterhasbro">twitch.tv/twisterhasbro</a>. If you are not familiar with the Twitch Rivals concept, it's a event/tournamet where famous Twitch streamers gather and play a specific game. The main goal of this event is to promote the game but also to have fun. There is also a big prize pool for everyone involved, so there will be serious competition. We will still anounce the upcoming games for the event (expect the new <b>"Twister X Trivial Pursuit"</b> to make an appearance as one of the games). However, we are happy to announce our list of players that will be competing against each other!</p>

    <p><i>Team line-up for the event</i></p>
</section>

<section class="article">
    <p>There will be 16 teams with 2 team members each. We have familiar faces like <b><i>Tfue, DrLupo, TimTheTatman, NICKMERCS</i></b> and many more. All of these contestants will compete against eachother to win a big prize. In the coorporation with these streamers, they will be giving away <b>discount codes</b> for our websites on their streams until the <b>4th of January!</b> These codes can be used to get discounts when buying our games. Every discount code can only be used once, so make sure to grab them before anyone else!</p>
